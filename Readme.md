# Connect.Flow - Time is Money

A decentralized creator economy platform built on the Flow blockchain where creators can monetize their time and expertise on FLOW blockchain.

## üöÄ Overview

Connect.Flow revolutionizes the creator economy by allowing creators to tokenize their time and expertise. Users can purchase time from creators using FLOW tokens through bonding curve contracts, creating a dynamic pricing mechanism based on supply and demand.

## üõ† Technology Stack

### Blockchain & Web3
- **Flow Blockchain**: Core blockchain infrastructure for smart contracts and transactions
- **RainbowKit**: Web3 wallet connection and authentication
- **Wagmi**: React hooks for Ethereum/Flow blockchain interactions
- **Viem**: TypeScript interface for blockchain interactions

### Frontend
- **Next.js 15**: React framework with App Router for server-side rendering
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe JavaScript development
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling
- **React Query**: Data fetching and state management

### Decentralized Storage & Identity
- **IPFS**: Decentralized storage for creator metadata (descriptions, tags, Twitter handles)
- **ENS (Ethereum Name Service)**: Human-readable addresses and reverse lookups
- **Nouns**: NFT-based profile pictures and visual identity

## üéØ Key Features

### Creator Registration & Profile Management
- **Nouns Integration**: Creators select from Nouns NFT collection for profile pictures
- **IPFS Metadata**: Creator descriptions, tags, and social links stored on IPFS
- **ENS Lookup**: Resolve ENS names to addresses and vice versa
- **Smart Contract Registration**: Creator data stored on Flow blockchain with bonding curve contracts

### Dynamic Pricing & Bonding Curves
- **Bonding Curve Contracts**: Automated pricing mechanism based on supply and demand
- **FLOW Token Integration**: Native token for all transactions
- **Real-time Price Updates**: Live pricing from smart contracts

### User Experience
- **Explore Page**: Discover and browse creators with real-time data
- **Buy/Sell Interface**: Purchase time from creators with slippage protection
- **Dashboard**: Track transactions, earnings, and active sessions
- **Leaderboard**: Top creators ranked by market cap and activity

## üèó Architecture

### Smart Contracts
- **TimeFactory.sol**: Main contract for creator registration and management
- **Time.sol**: Individual creator tokens with bonding curve mechanics
- **ERC20Mock.sol**: FLOW token mock for testing and development

### Data Flow
1. **Creator Registration**: 
   - Creator registers on Flow blockchain with name and token symbol
   - Profile metadata (bio, tags, Twitter) uploaded to IPFS
   - Nouns NFT selected for profile picture
   - Bonding curve contract deployed for pricing

2. **User Interaction**:
   - Users browse creators on explore page
   - Purchase time using FLOW tokens through bonding curves
   - Real-time price updates from smart contracts
   - Transaction history tracked on dashboard

3. **ENS Integration**:
   - Lookup ENS names to get wallet addresses
   - Reverse lookup to get ENS names from addresses
   - Enhanced user experience with human-readable addresses
